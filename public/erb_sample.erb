This is a sample erb template in /public. Put erb templates of all your server
config files in /public, along with static files. Pixie generates many
variables you need to boot and install your OS images and makes them available
to your template. See some samples below:

IP: <%=@you.ip%>
<%if @subnet[:gateway]%>
Subnet: <%=@subnet[:subnet]%>
Gateway: <%=@subnet[:gateway]%>
Nameserver: <%=@subnet[:nameserver_string]%>
Netmask: <%=@subnet[:mask]%>
<%else%>
Your subnet isn't in my config. Try adding it to config/subnets.yml.
<%end%>

For an exhaustive listing, see /env. Also try overriding the target server with
the form on the front page to see what variables you'll get for an actual
server (rather than your desktop).
